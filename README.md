SwiftUI View's protocol modifiers

View is a type that represents part of your appâ€™s user interface and provides modifiers that you use to configure views.
This repo shows examples of the usage of modifiers provided by View protocol.

To understand how everything works, I use the examples described in the official Apple documentation. 
And I supplement it with examples found in other places.

You are welcome to check this out and contribute with your own examples! Enjoy and happy coding! :)
